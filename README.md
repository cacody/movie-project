This simple Python program generates a list of my favorite movies based on the project guidlines for the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree progrm (Project 1) through Udacity.com. 

I liked the initial design as provided. I added a joking comment to the class definition as a way to emphasize why the movie is a mood-lifter. 

Adding additional movies is as simple as copying and instance created in the entertainment_center file and creation a new one. Of course, you'll have to search for a reliable source for the movie art and the YouTube trailer URL.
