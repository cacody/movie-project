This simple Python program generates a list of my favorite movies based on the project guidelines for the Full Stack Developer Nanodegree progrm (Project 1) through Udacity.com. 

I liked the initial design as provided. I added a joking comment to the class definition as a way to emphasize why the movie is a mood-lifter for me. 

Adding additional movies is as simple as copying one of the existing instances in the entertainment_center.py file and creating a new one. Of course, you'll have to search for a reliable source for the movie art and the YouTube trailer URL. 

The starting code came from udacity.com course, "Programming Foundations with Python." Customization was added by Corin Cody (student in Udacity's "Full Stack Developer" nanodegree: https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)
