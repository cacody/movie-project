`python entertainment_center.py`. 
This will generate a compiled python file and an HTML file. 
Open the HTML file in a web browser.

with yours.

##Sources

The original code came from a [Udacity](http://udacity.com) course. 
I modified the *entertainment_center.py* file to include my chosen movies. 
I also added an additional data attribute to the Movie object named 
*value_to_my_brain* - a short phrase to describe why I like the movie.
